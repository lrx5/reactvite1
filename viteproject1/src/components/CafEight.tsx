          <p>
          The times on the pandemic were pretty rough. With classes having been switched to online, lockdowns enforced everywhere, you're stuck in your house with nowhere to go. At this point in time, I was starting to miss out hanging with my friends during our breaktime at the cafeteria.

          <h2>Modelling</h2>
          <p>This is where my background on LinkedIn has come from. I was so pleased with my calculator model that I decided to do a close-up shot of it and make it as a background.</p>
          <img src={`src/assets/cafeight/cafeight_11.png`} alt="" />
          <p>I really liked how my Graham Mango Shake turned out. ðŸ¥¤ It looks amazing close-up with all the graham bits on top.</p>
