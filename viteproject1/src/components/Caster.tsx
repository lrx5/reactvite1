          <h1>Caster Wheel</h1>
          <h3>Blender â€¢ May 2023</h3>
          <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I tried to make a realistic 3D Caster wheel sample as a project submission based job application.</p>

          <h2>Clay Model</h2>
          <p>Try dragging it around! Unfortunately you can't see the materials that I made for the model in Spline. </p>

          <h2>Modelling</h2>
          <p>The process of creating this caster only took a single day, a combined 6 hours of modelling and tweaking. I had blueprints to work from which sped up the modelling process, as I am used to making models from CAD before in school.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>I have received important feedbacks that the wheel's edges were not smooth enough, and the metal material on the wheel were far on the rough side. I learned to apply more subdivisions in the future and to be very meticulous in rendering the final outputs. Nevertheless, I am thankful for the company for giving me an opportunity to show my work. ðŸ˜Š</p>
