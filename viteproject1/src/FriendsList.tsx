          Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I recently built a website to test my Bootstrap skills out. I was inspired to  make a company landing page after seeing the Illustration work of my good friend Jeron on Karzhyn branding. This personal project took around 2 weeks to code this company idea while exploring the features Bootstrap has to offer.
